# Array-sorting-methods
This repository provides an overview and implementation of various array sorting methods.
 
## Contents
### Insertion Sort
A simple, efficient algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time, by repeatedly taking the next element from the unsorted part and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part.
### Bubble Sort
A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
### Merge Sort
A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves back together.
### Quick Sort 
A highly efficient sorting algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot, then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
### Heap Sort
A comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.
